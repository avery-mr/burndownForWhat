* Include a Final Status Report and reflection for
  * What you completed
    * We successfully delivered a functional MVP that meets the core objective of our project: to create a web-based platform where climbers can connect, coordinate 
     events, and share their passion for climbing. The application includes low-fidelity login functionality, allowing users to log in and maintain their session 
     across multiple pages.
    * Through session tracking, we implemented key features that interact with our database using both GET and POST requests. These features include:
      * Editing and displaying basic user profile information
      * Creating and viewing climbing events
      * Sending and viewing previously sent messages.
    *This MVP lays the groundwork for a more refined version of the app with expanded functionality and improved user experience in future iterations. 
  * What you were in the middle of implementing
  * What you had planned for the future
  * Any known problems (bugs, issues)
  * What we learned, what we'd do differently, what worked and didn't, alternatives we thought, explanation of why we made different decisions.
* List your public hosting site and make sure that it is available: https://belay-buddy.onrender.com/
