* Include a Final Status Report and reflection for
  * What you completed
    * We successfully delivered a functional MVP that meets the core objective of our project: to create a web-based platform where climbers can connect, coordinate 
     events, and share their passion for climbing. The application includes low-fidelity login functionality, allowing users to log in and maintain their session 
     across multiple pages.
    * Through session tracking, we implemented key features that interact with our database using both GET and POST requests. These features include:
      * Editing and displaying basic user profile information
      * Creating and viewing climbing events
      * Sending and viewing previously sent messages.
    * We also added an embedded Google Maps search which allows the user to see common climbing areas nearby.
    * This MVP lays the groundwork for a more refined version of the app with expanded functionality and improved user experience in future iterations. 
  * What you were in the middle of implementing
    * One key feature that remains incomplete is the ability for users to "join" an event, which is essential to fulfilling the minimum use case for the events  
      functionality. Implementing this feature requires additional backend logic to insert data into a user-event join table, introducing a level of complexity 
      beyond the basic features completed so far. Additionally, we plan to expand the events feature by introducing search functionality. This would enable users to 
      filter and discover climbing meetups based on criteria such as skill level, location, and climbing discipline, significantly enhancing the platformâ€™s 
      usability and relevance.
  * What you had planned for the future
  * Any known problems (bugs, issues)
  * What we learned, what we'd do differently, what worked and didn't, alternatives we thought, explanation of why we made different decisions.
* List your public hosting site and make sure that it is available: https://belay-buddy.onrender.com/
