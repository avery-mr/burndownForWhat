### Meeting Time
Sundays @ 5:00 PM MT

### Vision Statement
To create a world where every climber has access to a safe and reliable belay partner, fostering a vibrant and inclusive climbing community that empowers individuals to reach new heights. We envision Belay Buddy as the go-to platform for climbers to connect, build relationships, and confidently pursue their passion for climbing, whether on real rock or in the gym. By simplifying the process of finding partners and promoting safety and trust, Belay Buddy will break down barriers to entry, encourage participation, and strengthen the bonds within the climbing community.

### Motivation
To build a full stack web application that applies the course material including: authentication, a database, and a simple API. In addition to learning technologies, we will also focus on design, planning, development, and testing in the context of group collaboration. While the principal goal will be to create something earning an ‘A’  in CSPB3308, many have also expressed interest in building something for our respective GitHub repos for resume building.
