### Meeting Time
Sundays @ 5:00 PM MT

### Vision Statement
To create a world where every climber has access to a safe and reliable belay partner, fostering a vibrant and inclusive climbing community that empowers individuals to reach new heights. We envision Belay Buddy as the go-to platform for climbers to connect, build relationships, and confidently pursue their passion for climbing, whether on real rock or in the gym. By simplifying the process of finding partners and promoting safety and trust, Belay Buddy will break down barriers to entry, encourage participation, and strengthen the bonds within the climbing community.

### Motivation
Problem/need: The problem/need our project addresses is the inefficiency in finding a climbing “buddy”. Usually, partners are difficult to find, and if we match up partners using a website then it will be a way to bring the climbing community closer together as well as allow faster matchups between climbing partners.

Significance: The significance of this problem is that many climbing enthusiasts cannot find a partner, as different online groups/communities may exist and be hard to find. By centralizing these communities within one website, it will make it easier to find a belay buddy instead of having to reach out to individual groups as there will be one centralized website where everyone can access and quickly find a climbing partner. If someone is traveling to a new state, they will be able to be matched up for the time/location of interest.

Passion/personal connection: Many within our group are rock climbing enthusiasts who would like to see the climbing community strengthened in their local areas/communities.

Broader impact/long-term vision: long term, Belay Buddy will become a reliable source of finding partners within the climbing community, allowing safe access for people to meet up. One day, Belay Buddy may be used to match up people based on location of interest, intensity of the climbing activity, and other things such as level of comfort/training or experience with climbing (such as being a novice/beginner vs. an expert).

Other personal motivations: To build a full stack web application that applies the course material including: authentication, a database, and a simple API. In addition to learning technologies, we will also focus on design, planning, development, and testing in the context of group collaboration.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategy

  *   Design the application architecture with scalability in mind from the start
  *   Conduct regular performance testing and optimize as needed
  *   Eventually implement cloud-based solutions that can easily scale resources
* __Security__
  *   Conduct regular SEcurity assessments and penetration testing
  *   Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
  *   Encrypt sensitive data, especially user information
  *   Keep all software components and libraries up-to-date
* __Scope Creep__
  *   Clearly define project requirements and features
  *   Use Agile methodology to manage changing requirements
  *   Regularly review and prioritize features with stakeholders
* __Communication Breakdown__
  *   Establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins
  *   Use project management tools to track progress and assignments
  *   Encourage open dialogue and create a collaborative environment
* __Low User Engagement__
  *   Conduct user research and usability testing throughout development
  *   Implement an intuitive, user-friendly interface
  *   Gather and act on user feedback regularly
